# Description

This project is to convert AI architecture diagram to actual PyTorch code.
Our aim is to help AI researchers and engineers to co-work with visualized AI model architecture, not the source code that is too long to catch in a single sight.
Currently, we managed to make user to draw DNN structure and convert it to PyTorch code.

# Stack
- **Language** : Typescript, Python
- **Library & Framework** : React, [Pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide), [React-Diagram](https://github.com/projectstorm/react-diagrams)
